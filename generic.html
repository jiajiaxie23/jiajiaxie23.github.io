									<p>In light of the recent pandemic it became clear that the present highly connected world is at great risk when a novel air-born pathogen appears in the human population. With vaccine development operating at a longer timescale than disease spread, other measures to contain a pathogen need to be put in place. The main containment measures used have been social distancing, contact tracing and isolation of infected patients. However we have seen that short and long term compliance with social distancing norms is a major issue and even with all the present measures, hospitals and health care facilities are hardest hit by the pandemic since their populations are more at risk. The question thus arises if we can use other measures to protect these high-risk networks. </p>
									<p> One proposed measure to contain epidemics has been  immune shielding. The idea behind immune shielding is that we can use individuals who have already acquired antibodies (recovered individuals) and strategically place them in the high-risk community such that their placement decreases the overall spread of the disease. In practice this could mean reassigning patients to health care workers (HCWs) based on their infectiousness. Given that some HCWs might be recovered we propose that changing patients lists might decrease the risk of disease transmission and eventually decrease the size of the outbreak within the health facility. The motivation behind reassigning patients is to replacing risky connections (susceptible - infected) with safe connections (recovered - infected) which do not further transmit the disease.</p>
									<p>The idea of immune shielding has been proposed before in the context of large, well-mixed networks but has not been thoroughly studied on smaller, sparse networks which is where immune shielding is most likely to be implemented. While there are many approaches on implementing this strategy, we are interested in what the optimal one is and how much can it improve the outcome of an outbreak. Finding the implicit limits of this strategy will allow for a more realistic assessment of immune shielding performance in small communities and open new possibilities for further implementations.</p>
